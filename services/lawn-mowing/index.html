    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>How often should I schedule lawn mowing?</h3>
    <p>Most homeowners benefit from weekly mowing during the growing season. For water-wise maintenance, a bi-weekly
        schedule works well and still keeps the grass looking tidy.</p>

    <h3>Do you provide equipment for edging and blowing?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Every visit includes precise edging along walkways and driveways, plus blowing to remove clippings and
        debris for a clean finish.</p>

    <h3>What makes your service “locally owned”?</h3>
    <p>We are a family-run business based in the Antelope Valley. Our crew lives in the area, understands the climate,
        and is committed to serving neighbors with reliable, friendly service.</p>

    <h3>Can I combine lawn mowing with other services?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. We offer bundled packages that include garden care, yard cleanup, irrigation, and more. Contact us to
        create a custom plan that fits your property’s needs.</p>
