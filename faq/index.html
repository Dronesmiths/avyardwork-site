            <p class="avyard-faq-lead">
                Common questions about maintaining a healthy lawn in Palmdale, Lancaster, and the Antelope Valley.
            </p>

            <div class="faq-grid">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How often should I mow my lawn in the Antelope Valley?</h3>
                    <p>During the growing season (spring and summer), mow weekly to maintain optimal lawn health. In
                        fall and winter, you can reduce to bi-weekly mowing as grass growth slows. Never remove more
                        than one-third of the grass blade height in a single mowing to avoid stressing your lawn.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the best grass type for Palmdale and Lancaster?</h3>
                    <p>For the High Desert climate, we recommend warm-season grasses like Bermuda grass or Buffalo
                        grass. These varieties are drought-tolerant, heat-resistant, and thrive in alkaline soil. Tall
                        fescue is also popular for its deep root system and ability to stay green year-round with
                        proper watering.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much should I water my lawn in the desert?</h3>
                    <p>In summer, water deeply 2-3 times per week in the early morning (before 8 AM). Aim for 1-1.5
                        inches of water per week total. In winter, reduce to once per week. Deep, infrequent watering
                        encourages deeper root growth and drought resistance. Avoid daily shallow watering, which
                        promotes weak roots.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why does my lawn have brown patches?</h3>
                    <p>Brown patches in Antelope Valley lawns are commonly caused by: (1) Underwatering or uneven
                        irrigation coverage, (2) Fungal disease from overwatering, (3) Grub damage from beetle larvae,
                        (4) Dog urine spots, or (5) Compacted soil preventing water absorption. Identify the cause
                        first, then treat accordingly—we can help diagnose and fix the issue.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What height should I cut my grass?</h3>
                    <p>For Bermuda grass, maintain 1-1.5 inches. For tall fescue, keep it at 2.5-3 inches. Taller grass
                        shades the soil, reduces water evaporation, and develops deeper roots—critical for High Desert
                        conditions. Adjust your mower height seasonally: slightly taller in summer heat, shorter in
                        cooler months.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I bag or mulch grass clippings?</h3>
                    <p>Mulching is better for your lawn. Grass clippings decompose quickly and return nitrogen to the
                        soil, reducing fertilizer needs. Only bag clippings if the grass is excessively long, wet, or
                        diseased. Mulching also saves time and reduces yard waste.</p>

                Expert guidance for water-efficient, beautiful desert landscapes in the Antelope Valley.
            </p>

            <div class="faq-grid">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is xeriscaping and is it right for my yard?</h3>
                    <p>Xeriscaping is water-efficient landscaping using drought-tolerant plants, mulch, and efficient
                        irrigation. It's ideal for the Antelope Valley because it reduces water bills by 50-75%,
                        requires
                        less maintenance, and thrives in our climate. You can have a beautiful yard with native plants,
                        decorative rock, and strategic green spaces without the high water costs of traditional lawns.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What are the best plants for High Desert landscaping?</h3>
                    <p>Top choices include: Desert marigold, California poppy, lavender, rosemary, agave, yucca, and
                        palo verde trees. These plants are native or adapted to our alkaline soil, extreme heat, and low
                        rainfall. They require minimal water once established and add color and texture year-round.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I deal with alkaline soil in Palmdale?</h3>
                    <p>Antelope Valley soil typically has a pH of 7.5-8.5 (alkaline). To improve it: (1) Add sulfur or
                        gypsum to lower pH, (2) Mix in compost to improve drainage and nutrients, (3) Choose
                        alkaline-tolerant plants, or (4) Use raised beds with imported soil for vegetables and
                        acid-loving plants. Soil amendments work best when applied in fall or early spring.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I have a green lawn and save water?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Reduce your lawn size to high-traffic areas only, and replace the rest with xeriscape.
                        Install a smart irrigation controller that adjusts for weather. Use drought-tolerant grass
                        varieties. Aerate annually to improve water absorption. Even a 50% lawn reduction can cut water
                        use by 30-40% while maintaining curb appeal.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What mulch is best for desert landscaping?</h3>
                    <p>Decomposed granite (DG) and decorative rock are excellent for the High Desert. DG is affordable,
                        compacts well for pathways, and comes in natural colors. Rock mulch (3/4" to 1.5") doesn't
                        decompose, suppresses weeds, and reflects heat. Avoid wood mulch in full sun—it dries out
                        quickly and needs frequent replacement in our climate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How often should I water desert plants?</h3>
                    <p>Newly planted desert plants need weekly watering for the first 3-6 months to establish roots.
                        Once established, most need water only every 2-4 weeks in summer and monthly (or less) in
                        winter. Overwatering is the #1 killer of desert plants—they're adapted to drought and prefer
                        dry conditions.</p>

            <p class="avyard-faq-lead">
                Maximize water efficiency and keep your irrigation system running smoothly in the High Desert.
            </p>

            <div class="faq-grid">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I know if my sprinkler system is working efficiently?</h3>
                    <p>Signs of inefficiency include: (1) Dry spots or brown patches despite regular watering, (2) Water
                        pooling or runoff, (3) Sprinkler heads spraying onto sidewalks or driveways, (4) Unusually high
                        water bills, or (5) Visible leaks or broken heads. Run your system during the day once per
                        season to inspect coverage and make adjustments.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I use drip irrigation or sprinklers?</h3>
                    <p>Drip irrigation is ideal for desert plants, shrubs, trees, and vegetable gardens—it delivers
                        water directly to roots with 90% efficiency. Sprinklers work better for lawns and large turf
                        areas. Many Antelope Valley homes use both: drip for landscaping beds and sprinklers for grass
                        areas.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>When is the best time to water my lawn?</h3>
                    <p>Water between 4 AM and 8 AM. Early morning watering reduces evaporation loss (which can be 50%+
                        in afternoon heat), prevents fungal diseases from overnight moisture, and ensures water reaches
                        roots before the day's heat. Avoid evening watering—it keeps grass wet overnight, promoting
                        disease.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How can I reduce my water bill while keeping my yard green?</h3>
                    <p>Key strategies: (1) Install a smart irrigation controller (saves 20-30%), (2) Fix leaks
                        immediately, (3) Adjust sprinkler heads to eliminate overspray, (4) Water deeply but less
                        frequently, (5) Reduce lawn size by 25-50%, (6) Add mulch to retain soil moisture, and (7) Use
                        drought-tolerant plants in non-lawn areas.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What are signs my irrigation system needs repair?</h3>
                    <p>Watch for: Broken or stuck sprinkler heads, uneven spray patterns, water geysers (indicating
                        broken pipes), soggy areas that never dry, controller malfunctions, or zones that won't turn on.
                        In the Antelope Valley, hard water and mineral buildup can also clog drip emitters—flush your
                        system annually.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to winterize my irrigation system in Palmdale?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, but it's simpler than in colder climates. While we rarely get hard freezes, occasional
                        overnight freezes can damage exposed pipes and valves. Drain above-ground components, insulate
                        backflow preventers, and adjust your controller for reduced winter watering. Most in-ground
                        systems don't need full winterization.</p>

                        Cool-season grasses (like tall fescue) stay green and may need monthly mowing if actively
                        growing. Reduce mowing frequency to every 2-4 weeks depending on growth. Never mow frozen

                    <h3>Do you offer one-time cleanups or only recurring service?</h3>
                    <p>We offer both! One-time yard cleanups are perfect for overgrown properties, seasonal debris
                        removal, or preparing for HOA inspections. Recurring service (weekly or bi-weekly) is ideal for
                        ongoing lawn maintenance. Many customers start with a cleanup, then transition to regular
                        service to keep their yard pristine.</p>

                    <h3>How much does lawn mowing cost in Palmdale and Lancaster?</h3>
                    <p>Residential lawn mowing typically starts at $99/month for weekly or bi-weekly service, depending
                        on lawn size and property access. Larger properties or those requiring additional services
                        (edging, trimming, blowing) may cost more. We provide free estimates based on your specific
                        property—call (661) 498-4444 for a quote.</p>

                        service while you're away. We follow strict protocols to ensure gates are closed and locked
